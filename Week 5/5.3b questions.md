## Section 2: Evaluating K-means and Clustering Metrics

6. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** Which metrics can be used to evaluate K-means clustering quality?  
A. Within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)  
B. Calinski-Harabasz index  
C. Davies-Bouldin index  
D. Accuracy score  

7. **(Medium)** What does a silhouette score close to -1 indicate for a data point?

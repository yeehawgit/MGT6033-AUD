## Section 1: Topic Modeling Concepts and Workflow

1. **(Easy)** In the lecture example, what was the primary business benefit of topic modeling for the customer care manager?  
A. It guarantees perfect classification of every document  
B. It helps identify key issues and assign responsibility efficiently  
C. It replaces all human analysts  
D. It eliminates the need for data preprocessing  

2. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** Which of the following are limitations of using manual or keyword-based classification for large corpora?  
A. It is time-consuming  
B. It can miss rare but important issues  
C. It is always more objective than modeling  
D. It may introduce subjectivity from different analysts  

3. **(Medium)** What is the impact of poor preprocessing on topic model quality?  
A. It has no effect  
B. It can reduce the interpretability and accuracy of topics  
C. It always increases coherence  
D. It always makes the document-term matrix more sparse and slower  

4. **(Hard) ** Put the following steps to the topic modeling workflow in order as described in the lecture:  
A. Feature extraction  
B. Communicating results  
C. Model tuning and evaluation  
D. Model selection  
E. Preprocessing  

5. **(Hard)** Why might a manager prefer topic modeling over assigning a team to read and code every document?  
A. Topic modeling is less subjective and can scale to large corpora  
B. Human reading has poor interpretation  
C. Topic modeling requires no interpretation  
D. Manual coding always produces more consistent results  

## Section 2: Model Tuning, Evaluation, and Communication

6. **(Medium)** What is the role of hyperparameters in topic modeling?  
A. They control aspects of model training and behavior  
B. They are only used for data cleaning  
C. They determine the number of documents  
D. They are irrelevant for model quality  

7. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** Which metrics or approaches are used to evaluate the fit of a topic model?  
A. Perplexity  
B. Coherence  
C. Word intrusion tasks  
D. F1 score  

8. **(Hard)** What does a high coherence score indicate about a topic?  
A. The topic contains words that frequently occur together and make sense as a group  
B. The topic contains words that are rarely together and are likely not related
C. The topic contains only stop words  
D. The topic is not relevant to the corpus  

9. **(Hard)** What is the purpose of a word intrusion task in topic modeling evaluation?  
A. To test whether humans can identify an unrelated word in a topic list  
B. To test whether a model can identify an unrelated word in a topic list  
C. To count the number of topics  
D. To assign documents to clusters  

10. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** According to the lecture, what are effective ways to communicate topic modeling results?  
A. Visualizing topic prominence in the corpus  
B. Showing topic relevance for each document  
C. Printing all raw text in the corpus  
D. Analyzing topic similarities

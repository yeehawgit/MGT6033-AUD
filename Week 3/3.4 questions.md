# Quiz Questions

## Section 1: Named Entity Recognition (NER) Concepts

1. **(Easy)** What is the primary purpose of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in NLP?  
A. Translate text between languages  
B. Identify and categorize key information such as names, places, or products  
C. Correct grammar in documents  
D. Summarize long passages  

2. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** NER can be used in which of the following business settings?  
A. Customer support ticket routing  
B. Resume review in HR  
C. Assigning IT help desk requests  
D. Submitting a vacation request  

3. **(Hard)** In the context of NER, what is a "named entity"?  
A. Any verb in a document  
B. Any phrase with more than two words  
C. Specific objects of interest like people, locations, organizations, or products  
D. Any adjective that describes a noun  

4. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** According to the materials, which of the following are typical outputs or results of a NER process?  
A. Categorized entities from text (e.g., “MacOS” as PRODUCT)  
B. Sentiment scores  
C. Detection of explicit grammar errors  
D. Association of entities with document sections  

## Section 2: NER Methods and Process

5. **(Medium) Select all that apply:** What are the two primary steps in the NER process?  
A. Detect a named entity  
B. Categorize the named entity  
C. Translate the sentence  
D. Score the document's sentiment  

6. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** Which approaches are commonly used for NER in NLP, as described in the lecture?  
A. Lexicon-based approach  
B. Rule-based approach  
C. Machine-learning based approach  
D. Random word sampling approach  

7. **(Hard)** Which statement best describes a lexicon-based approach to NER?  
A. It uses a pre-prepared dictionary for matching entity names  
B. It learns entity categories from labeled data  
C. It generates artificial entities for testing  
D. It always outperforms machine learning approaches  

8. **(Hard)** Which approach is most suitable for identifying entities that follow well-defined textual patterns (e.g., capitalized cities or company names)?  
A. Lexicon-based  
B. Rule-based  
C. Manual annotation  
D. Visual inspection  

## Section 3: NER Limitations and Best Practices

9. **(Hard) Select all that apply:** What are limitations or challenges of the lexicon-based approach to NER?  
A. Poor performance on entities not in the dictionary  
B. Difficulty handling new or misspelled names  
C. Inability to identify entities with multiple meanings (ambiguity)  
D. Always requires a large, labeled training dataset in addition to the lexicon  

10. **(Medium)** According to the lecture, what is a common trait of state-of-the-art NER models today?  
A. They are entirely rule-based  
B. They routinely achieve over 90% accuracy  
C. They require no labeled data  
D. They ignore entities related to products

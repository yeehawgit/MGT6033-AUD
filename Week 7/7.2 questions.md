# Quiz Questions

## Section 1: Deep Learning Fundamentals

1. **(Easy)** What is the general rule of thumb for when a neural network is considered "deep learning"?  
A. Any network with more than one output node  
B. Any network with more than two or three layers  
C. Any network using only linear activation functions  
D. Any network that uses only image data  

2. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which of the following statements about deep learning are correct?  
A. Deep learning captures nuanced nonlinearities  
B. Each additional layer introduces another degree of nonlinearity  
C. Deep learning always requires more than 100 layers  
D. Deep learning models can have millions of parameters  

3. **(Hard)** Why is adding more layers to a neural network associated with increased modeling of nonlinear relationships?  
A. Each layer multiplies the input by zero  
B. Each layer adds a new linear transformation  
C. Each layer interacts with previous layers, introducing higher-order nonlinearities  
D. More layers always make the model slower but not more expressive  

## Section 2: Transfer Learning Concepts and Applications

4. **(Medium)** What is transfer learning in the context of NLP?  
A. Training a model from scratch for every new task  
B. Using a model trained on one task or corpus for a different but related task or corpus  
C. Only using models for the same dataset they were trained on  
D. Ignoring previous training when building new models  

5. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** In NLP, transfer learning can involve which of the following?  
A. Using a model for a different reason on the same corpus  
B. Using a model for a similar reason on a different corpus  
C. Using a model for a different reason on a different corpus  
D. Only using the model for the original task and corpus  

6. **(Hard)** Why does transfer learning work well in NLP according to the lecture?  
A. Context is similar across most language domains and problems  
B. All words have the same meaning in every context  
C. Transfer learning only works for image data  
D. Transfer learning does not require any labeled data  

7. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** What are key benefits of transfer learning for deep learning models in NLP?  
A. Greatly reduces training time  
B. Reduces data requirements for new tasks  
C. Allows starting from a model that already understands language context  
D. Makes it impossible to fine-tune models for new domains  

8. **(Medium)** In the provided example, which types of words or phrases are most likely to transfer well from movie reviews to patient feedback?  
A. Domain-specific terms like "cinematography"  
B. Generic sentiment terms like "absolutely fantastic" or "poor"  
C. Only adjectives  
D. Only nouns  

9. **(Hard)** What happens to embeddings and weights for words that do not translate well to a new domain during transfer learning?  
A. They are always deleted from the model  
B. Their weights are adjusted during fine-tuning  
C. They become stop words  
D. They are always set to zero  

10. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** According to the lecture, which of the following are accurate summaries of transfer learning in NLP?  
A. Transfer learning is most effective when word context does not change drastically across domains  
B. Few disciplines have a lexicon that is completely unique  
C. Transfer learning requires millions of labeled examples for every new task  
D. Deep learning models with transfer learning can capture language, context, and syntax for new tasks

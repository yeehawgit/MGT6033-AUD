1. **(Easy)** What does the character class `\s` match in regular expressions?  
A. Any single digit  
B. Any whitespace character (space, newline, etc.)  
C. Any uppercase letter  
D. Any punctuation mark  

2. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which of the following are valid ways to invert a character class in regex?  
A. Use a capital letter, e.g., `\S`  
B. Use a caret `^` inside square brackets, e.g., `[^aeiou]`  
C. Use a hyphen after the opening bracket, e.g., `[-aeiou]`  
D. Use a backslash before a lowercase letter, e.g., `\b`  

3. **(Hard)** What does the character class `\w` include?  
A. Only lowercase letters  
B. Letters, numbers, and underscores  
C. Only letters  
D. Only punctuation and spaces  

## Section 2: Positional Characters, OR Operator, and Anchors

4. **(Medium)** What does the `^` symbol represent in a regular expression?  
A. End of a string  
B. Start of a string  
C. Any digit  
D. Any non-digit  

5. **(Medium, Select all that apply):** Which of the following are true about the OR operator (`|`) in regex?  
A. It allows matching multiple alternatives  
B. It can be used inside and outside parentheses  
C. It always matches the longest possible string  
D. It is used to invert character classes  

## Section 3: Greedy vs. Lazy Matching

6. **(Medium)** What is the main difference between greedy and lazy quantifiers in regex?  
A. Greedy quantifiers match as little as possible; lazy quantifiers match as much as possible  
B. Greedy quantifiers match as much as possible; lazy quantifiers match as little as possible  
C. Both always match the same amount  
D. Lazy quantifiers only work with digits  

7. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** Which quantifiers can be made lazy by adding a `?` after them?  
A. *  
B. +  
C. {a,b}  
D. $  

## Section 4: Look Arounds and Dynamic Group Referencing

8. **(Hard, Select all that apply)** What regex pattern would return "cat" in the phrase "catfish catdog"?  
A. `cat(?=fish)`  
B. `(?<=cat)fish`  
C. `cat(?!fish)`  
D. `(?<!cat)fish`  

9. **(Hard, Select all that apply):** In the regular expression `\b(\w+\b)(\b[\w\s,]+?\b)(\1)(.*?)[.?!]`, what is the purpose of `(\1)`?  
A. It matches the same text as the first capturing group  
B. It allows dynamic group referencing  
C. It inverts the match  
D. It matches any digit  

10. **(Hard)** Why are dynamic group references useful in regular expressions?  
A. They allow matching repeated words or patterns  
B. They always speed up regex processing  
C. They are required for all greedy matches  
D. They only work with digits
